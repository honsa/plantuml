/**

 * <p>
 * Class diagrams (and other free-form graphs) are represented as a tree of
 * enities. The tree structure is represented using {@link Quark} objects, each
 * of which corresponds to an {@link net.sourceforge.plantuml.abel.Entity}. The
 * quark for an entity can be retrieved using a method on the entity, and
 * vice-versa.
